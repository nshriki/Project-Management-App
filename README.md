- Once you‚Äôve completed the activity:
- Test your app to ensure all functionality works as expected (e.g., filtering and form submission).
- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Share the link to the repository for review.

By the end of this activity, you should have.

- A React app that can manage and display a list of products.
